# Salaries-for-San-Francisco-Employee

Employee pay in San Francisco includes more than just base salaryâ€”it can also involve overtime, bonuses, and other benefits. This project looks at public compensation data to break it down in a clear and simple way. The goal is to help people understand how salaries are structured across different jobs and spot trends in how employees are paid.
